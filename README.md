# Getting Started with Create React App

A small project that loads audio files and gives the user the possibility to play and pause those files.

Take note that loading data from the API was broken at the point of development, so the audio files do not match the files retrieved from the API. For the sake of simplicity, different audio URLs are used.

To run the project, simply use `yarn && yarn start`.
